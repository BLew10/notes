# Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts

## Section 2: **Data Types**

* Rust is statically typed language, what does this mean? THis means that at compile time **ALL** variabl types must be known. 

## Scalar Types
* A scalar type represents a single value
    * Examples of these in rust are integers, floating-point numbers, booleans and characters

### Integer Types
* u32 => unsigned integer (only positive)
* i32 => signed integer
    * Each take up 32 bits of space

### Floating-Point Types
* f32 and f64
* Rust has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rustâ€™s floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs, itâ€™s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

### Boolean Types

* Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool. For example:

```rust 
fn main() {
    let t = true;
    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

### Character Type
* Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rustâ€™s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. 

```rust 
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

### **Convert String to Integer Example**

```rust
fn main() {
    let guess = "42";
    let guess: u32 = guess.parse().expect("Not a number!")
    println!("The value of x is: {guess}");
}
```


## Scalar Types
* Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays
    
### Tuple
* A general way to group values together in one compound type
* Fixed length
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    // accessing the value we want
    let first_item = tup.0;
    let second_item = tup.1;
    let third_item = tup.2;
}
```
* Destructing a **tup**
```rust 
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
// How to destructure
    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

### Array 
* Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. 
* Fixed length
* This is a way to maximize efficiency. Indicies greater than the length of the array will result in array. Other languages, these indicies are still accessible. 
```rust 
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    //explicit
    let b: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let c = [3;5];
    // output is c = [3,3,3,3,
}
```
