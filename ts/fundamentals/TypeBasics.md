# Type Basics
- Statically typed
    - Once a typed is defined, it **cannot** be changed later
- Can be changed
- We don't have to explicit state what the type is like in C#
- It uses inference to determine what the type is based off what it is set to
 ## Variable Declaration
```ts
let
var
const
```

## How to validate a type input in TS
```ts
const addNums = (x: number, y:number) => {
    return x+y
}
```
