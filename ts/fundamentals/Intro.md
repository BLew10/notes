# Introduction
## What is TypeScript?
- Superset of js
    - Basically an extension of js
    - Browsers do not understand ts, compiler must compile into js in order for browsers to use it
- Allows us to use `strict` types
    - Good for error checking -> cleaner and better code
- Extra features
    - generics, interfaces, tuples
