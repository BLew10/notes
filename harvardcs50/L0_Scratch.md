## What is Computer Science?
- Binary
    - What is a bit?
        - It is a 0 or 1
- Computers are filled with things called **transisters**, which are switches
    - "On" they represent a 1
    - "Off" -> 0
    - The combination of on and offs represent a certain value
    - The way they are set are `base-2`
        - 1 2 4 -> Every number from 1 to 7 is met via a combination of a light being on
        - The algo would the largest number is 2*(highest number)-1
        - Example -> 7 would be the highest from above 2*4-1 =7
- We use a `base-10` system
    - Example 123
    - 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0 = 123
- Base-2 same calculation
    - Example 5
    - 4 2 1 (remember these are represented as 1's and 0's)
    - 1 0 1 -> 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 5
- We use bytes
    - 8 bits in 1 byte
- The question is, if we are using bytes to store numbers, how do we store a letter?
    - We can assign a number to a letter
    - Ex: A -> 65
- ASCII is how we map from numbers to letters
- Use Unicode to for other languages/characters/emojis

- We aren't nec
