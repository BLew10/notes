# ASP.NET


## What is ASP.NET MVC Core?
- It is an open source, cross platform web dev framework built by Microsoft
## Explain MVC Architecture
- Architecure pattern divided into three layers
- Model has classes of the real world objects are application will use. Will contain their fields, validations
- Controller
    - handles responses, requests, routing
    - Binds the model and view
- Views has the UI
- ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that provides a variety of built-in functionality for building web applications. Some of the key features and functionality that ASP.NET provides include:

    - **Server-side scripting:** ASP.NET allows developers to write server-side code in languages such as C# and Visual Basic, which can be executed on the server before the page is sent to the client.

    - **Web Forms:** ASP.NET Web Forms provides a way to build web pages using a familiar event-driven programming model, similar to the way desktop applications are built. It allows developers to create pages using a drag-and-drop interface and provides a rich set of server controls that can be used to create web pages.

    - **Model View Controller (MVC):** ASP.NET MVC is a lightweight, highly testable presentation framework that is integrated with the existing ASP.NET features such as forms authentication and membership-based authorization.

    - Web API: ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building RESTful web services using the .NET Framework. It makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices.

    - **Web Pages:** ASP.NET Web Pages is a lightweight framework for building dynamic web sites with Razor syntax. Razor allows you to write server code using C# or Visual Basic within a HTML page.

    - **Security:** ASP.NET provides built-in security features such as authentication and authorization, which help to protect web applications from unauthorized access. It also includes a number of other security-related features such as encryption and validation.

   - **Data Access:** ASP.NET provides a number of ways to access and manipulate data, including ADO.NET and Entity Framework, which allow developers to interact with databases in an easy and efficient way.

    - **Deployment:** ASP.NET provides built-in support for deploying web applications to different environments, such as IIS, Azure, and other platforms.

- These are some of the main built-in functionality that ASP.NET provides. It is a robust and powerful web application framework that allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications easily and efficiently.
