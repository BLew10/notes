# Agile Methodology / SCRUM

## **``Agile``**
- Agile Methodology is a set of principles and practices for software development that promotes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. The Agile approach values working software, collaboration with customers, and flexibility in response to change. Agile development emphasizes iterative and incremental delivery, adaptive planning, and continuous improvement.

## **``SCRUM``**

- Scrum is a framework for implementing Agile Methodology. It provides a structure for teams to work together in an Agile way. The Scrum framework is a set of roles, events, and rules that provides a way to structure and manage the work of a development team.

    - The main components of Scrum are:

        - Scrum Team: A cross-functional team of people with all the skills necessary to deliver a working product.
        - Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features or requirements for the product being developed.
            - User stories, on the other hand, are a specific type of item that can be included in a product backlog. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end-user. User stories are written in natural language and typically follow a specific format such as: "As a [user], I want [something], so that [benefit]." User stories are used to capture the functional requirements of the system and are an effective way to communicate the needs of the stakeholders to the development team.
        - Sprint: A time-boxed period of usually 2-4 weeks in which a potentially releasable product increment is created.
        - Sprint Planning: A meeting where the team plans the work they will do during the next sprint.
        - Daily Scrum: A brief meeting where team members discuss their progress and plan their work for the next day.
        - Sprint Review: A meeting where the team demonstrates the work they have done during the sprint.
        - Sprint Retrospective: A meeting where the team reflects on the sprint and identifies ways to improve.
        - Scrum provides a way for development teams to work together effectively and efficiently, it promotes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It also allows for continuous improvement, adaptive planning and encourages feedback and learning throughout the development process.

    - The ``Scrum team`` is composed of three main roles: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team. 
        - The ``Product Owner`` is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and maintaining the product backlog. 
        - The ``Scrum Master`` is responsible for facilitating the scrum process and removing any obstacles that are blocking the team's progress. 
        - The ``Development Team`` is responsible for delivering the product, completing the work in the sprint and for producing a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each sprint.

- In summary, Agile Methodology is a set of principles and practices for software development that promotes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Scrum is a framework for implementing Agile Methodology, it provides a structure for teams to work together in an Agile way by using a set of roles, events, and rules. Scrum provides a way for development teams to work together effectively and efficiently, it promotes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction and allows for continuous improvement, adaptive planning and encourages feedback and learning throughout the development process.
