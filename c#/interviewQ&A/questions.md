# Questions

**What is your experience with C#?**
I have several years of experience working with C#, primarily on the back-end of web applications. I am familiar with the core language features and have experience working with popular frameworks such as .NET Core and ASP.NET.

**Can you explain the concept of object-oriented programming in C#?**
Object-oriented programming, or OOP, is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and their interactions to model and solve complex problems. C# is an object-oriented language and it provides several features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism which are key concepts of OOP.

**How do you handle exceptions and errors in C#?**
I handle exceptions and errors in C# using try-catch statements. I also make use of C# exception handling mechanism such as try-catch-finally, throw and using statement. Additionally, I also make use of logging libraries such as log4net or NLog to log the errors for further analysis.

**Can you explain the difference between a class and a struct in C#?**
A class and a struct are both used to define custom data types in C#. The main difference between them is that a class is a reference type, while a struct is a value type. Classes are stored on the heap, while structs are stored on the stack. Additionally, classes can have constructors and destructors, while structs cannot.

**Have you ever worked with any C# frameworks or libraries? Which ones?**
Yes, I have experience working with several C# frameworks and libraries such as .NET Core, ASP.NET, and Entity Framework. I have used .NET Core to build web applications and ASP.NET for building enterprise-level applications. I have also used Entity Framework for database interaction.

**How do you implement data validation in C#?**
I use C# built-in validation methods such as isNumeric(), IsLetter() and IsSymbol() to validate data types. I also use regular expressions to validate user input.

**Can you explain the concept of threading in C#?**
Threading is a technique that allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously within a single process. C# provides several classes, such as Thread and Task, that enable multithreading. By using threading, we can improve the performance of our application by running multiple tasks simultaneously and avoid freezing of our application.

**How do you manage dependencies in a C# application?**
I use a dependency injection framework such as Autofac or Ninject to manage dependencies in my C# applications. This allows me to easily manage the lifecycle of dependencies and decouple my code.

**How do you handle database interactions in C#?**
I use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework such as Entity Framework or NHibernate to handle database interactions in C#. These frameworks provide a way to interact with a database using objects, making it easier to write and maintain database-related code.

**Can you explain the difference between a synchronous and asynchronous method in C#?**
A synchronous method runs in a linear fashion, where one line of code must be executed before the next line can be executed. An asynchronous method, on the other hand, allows multiple lines of code to be executed
