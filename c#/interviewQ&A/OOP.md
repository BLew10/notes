# OOP Questions

## What is OOP?

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects and their interactions with each other. It's a way of designing and organizing software that focuses on creating reusable and modular code by encapsulating data and behavior within objects.

- Objects in OOP are instances of classes, which are blueprint templates for creating objects. Classes contain properties (data) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of the object. OOP allows for encapsulation of data and behavior, which means that an object's internal state can be hidden from other objects, and can only be accessed or modified through its methods.

## What are the four principles of OOP?

- The four principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the implementation details of an object and only exposing the necessary information through its methods and properties. Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes, which can help to reduce code duplication and improve code reuse. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, and enables code to be written in a more generic and flexible way. Abstraction is the process of reducing complexity by breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
