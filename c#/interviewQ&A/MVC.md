# Models Views Controllers
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. These components work together to create a clean, organized, and maintainable architecture for building web applications.

The **Model** represents the data and the business logic of the application. It contains the data and the methods that are used to manipulate that data. The Model is responsible for managing the state of the application and for performing any data-related operations.

The **View** is the user interface of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data to the user and for capturing any user input. The View is typically implemented using a template engine, which allows developers to define the layout and the appearance of the application using HTML and CSS.

The **Controller** is the component that manages the flow of data between the Model and the View. It receives input from the user, processes it, and updates the Model and the View accordingly. The Controller is responsible for handling the events and the actions of the application, such as handling form submissions and performing redirects.

The MVC pattern follows a pattern of "Separation of Concerns". Each component has a specific role and is designed to be independent of the other components. This allows for easy maintenance and scalability, as well as a clear separation of responsibilities, making it easier to understand and test the code.

To give an example of how it works, when a user interacts with the application, say by submitting a form, the Controller receives the input and processes it. It updates the Model with the new data and then tells the View to update the display accordingly. This flow of data and logic is done through the process of routing, where the user's action is directed to the appropriate controller method, which in turn updates the model and the view.

In summary, the MVC pattern is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. These components work together to create a clean, organized, and maintainable architecture for building web applications, allowing for easier maintenance, scalability and a clear separation of responsibilities.
